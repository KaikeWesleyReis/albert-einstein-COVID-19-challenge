# Albert Einstein COVID-19 Challenge
**Description**: This dataset contains anonymized data from patients seen at the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, at São Paulo, Brazil, and who had samples collected to perform the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and additional laboratory tests during a visit to the hospital.

All data were anonymized following the best international practices and recommendations. All clinical data were standardized to have a mean of zero and a unit standard deviation.


**Content**: This notebook presents an end-to-end solution for proposed tasks. Initially is analyzed missing data then propose a dataset based in original one. After that was developed an Exploratory Data Analysis and Predictive Analysis (answering the tasks) finishing the proposed solution.

 Summarizing, this repository contains a submission for COVID-19 Challenge.
